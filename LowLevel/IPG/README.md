This is the official repo of our paper ["Image Processing GNN: Breaking Rigidity in Super-Resolution"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Tian_Image_Processing_GNN_Breaking_Rigidity_in_Super-Resolution_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf). We proposed IPG, a Graph-based SR model that achieves outstanding performance on various SR benchmarks.

Code & weights will be released soon (we are sorry that we cannot release codes and weights in time due to code-checks within the corporation; but we will release it asap after the check is completed). Stay tuned!

## News

6/19/2024: Our work selected as Best Student Runner-up of CVPR'24!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

6/2/2024: We open-sourced [U-DiT](https://github.com/YuchuanTian/U-DiT), an efficient U-Net-style DiT variant.
