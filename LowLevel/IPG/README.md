# [CVPR2024 Oral] Image Processing GNN: Breaking Rigidity in Super-Resolution

This is the official repo of our paper "Image Processing GNN: Breaking Rigidity in Super-Resolution". We proposed IPG, a Graph-based SR model that achieves outstanding performance on various SR benchmarks.

Code & weights will be released soon. Stay tuned!
